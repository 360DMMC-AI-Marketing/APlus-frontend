## 1. Executive Summary

The Samia branch was created to integrate the APlus-frontend React app with the real APlusMedDepot backend API, replacing mock data with live API calls. During the QA audit, **18 bugs** were discovered and fixed across API integration, field name mismatches, broken workflows, missing UI components, and role/permission issues. The project now has a functional end-to-end flow for customer shopping, vendor product management, admin approval, and payment processing.

**Key areas of work:**

- Fixed all API endpoint integrations (products, cart, orders, payments, auth)
- Fixed field name mismatches between frontend (camelCase/snake_case) and backend responses
- Fixed vendor portal access (role `"supplier"` vs `"vendor"` mismatch)
- Rebuilt vendor product CRUD with proper supplier-specific endpoints and image upload
- Rebuilt admin product approval page with approve/reject/request-changes workflow
- Fixed order history page (wrong response key, missing status labels)
- Fixed registration flow (role mapping, field names, password validation)
- Added toast notifications for cart actions
- Fixed Navbar display for all user types

| --- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1   | **Product images field mismatch** — frontend read `product.image` (string) but backend returns `product.images` (array of URLs) | ProductsPage, ProductDetailPage, CartPage | Changed to `product.images?.[0] \|\| '/placeholder.svg'` everywhere          |
| 2   | **Stock field mismatch** — frontend read `stock_quantity` but backend returns `stockQuantity`                                   | ProductsPage, ProductDetailPage           | Added `stockQuantity` as first fallback in all nullish coalescing chains     |
| 3   | **Supplier name field mismatch** — frontend read `product.supplier` but backend returns `supplierName`                          | ProductsPage                              | Changed to `product.supplierName \|\| product.supplier`                      |
| 4   | **Vendor role mismatch** — frontend checked `role === 'vendor'` but backend returns `role: 'supplier'`                          | authStore.js, Navbar, ProtectedRoute      | Changed `isVendor()` and `isSupplier()` to check `=== 'supplier'`            |
| 5   | **Registration role mismatch** — frontend sent `role: 'vendor'` but backend only accepts `'supplier'`                           | authStore.js                              | Added mapping: `vendor → supplier` before sending to API                     |
| 6   | **Registration field mismatch** — frontend sent `company` but backend expects `companyName`                                     | authStore.js                              | Mapped `companyName: formData.companyName \|\| formData.company`             |
| 7   | **Order history empty** — backend returns `{ orders: [...] }` but frontend read `data.data`                                     | OrderHistoryPage                          | Changed to `data.orders \|\| data.data \|\| data`                            |
| 8   | **Vendor products used wrong API** — called global `GET /products` + broken `user.vendorId` filter                              | VendorProducts                            | Switched to `GET /suppliers/products` (auto-filters by auth)                 |
| 9   | **Admin products had no approval workflow** — no approve/reject buttons, used wrong API endpoint                                | AdminProducts                             | Complete rewrite with approve/reject/request-changes + `GET /admin/products` |

| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10  | **Double cart sync** — `syncCartToBackend()` called in both CheckoutPage and PaymentPage                                                                                                           | CheckoutPage, PaymentPage                                      | Removed from CheckoutPage, kept in PaymentPage (closest to order creation)         |
| 11  | **No product images in grid** — ProductsPage cards showed only name/price, no image                                                                                                                | ProductsPage                                                   | Added `<img>` tag with product thumbnail to grid cards                             |
| 12  | **Forgot password link broken** — `href="#"` instead of route link                                                                                                                                 | LoginPage                                                      | Changed to `<Link to="/forgot-password">`                                          |
| 13  | **Password validation too weak** — frontend only checked min 8 chars, backend requires uppercase + lowercase + number + special char                                                               | RegisterPage                                                   | Added full validation with individual error messages                               |
| 14  | **Net30 eligibility hardcoded** — always showed `true` with $50,000 placeholder                                                                                                                    | PaymentPage, users.js                                          | Wired to real `GET /users/me/credit` endpoint                                      |
| 15  | **Order status labels mismatched** — frontend had `delivered/shipped/processing`, backend uses `pending_payment/payment_confirmed/awaiting_fulfillment/fully_shipped/delivered/cancelled/refunded` | OrderHistoryPage                                               | Updated all status labels and badge colors to match backend values                 |
| 16  | **Vendor pages field name mismatches** — snake_case vs camelCase for `businessName`, `commissionRate`, `currentBalance`, `orderNumber`, `payoutAmount`, `productCategories`, etc.                  | VendorDashboard, VendorOrders, VendorAnalytics, VendorSettings | Prioritized camelCase fields (matching backend response) with snake_case fallbacks |
| 17  | **Vendor product response parsing** — backend returns `{ products: [...] }` but frontend read `data.data`                                                                                          | VendorProducts, VendorDashboard, VendorAnalytics               | Fixed to `data.products \|\| data.data \|\| data`                                  |
| 18  | **Navbar user display broken** — showed `user.name` but backend returns `firstName`/`lastName`                                                                                                     | Navbar                                                         | Changed to `user.firstName + user.lastName` with fallback to `user.email`          |

**Changes in QA audit:** No changes.
**Status:** Working correctly.

#### `src/api/auth.js`

**Route:** `POST /auth/login`, `POST /auth/register`
**Changes in Samia branch:** Created — login saves `accessToken` to localStorage, returns `data.user`.
**Changes in QA audit:** No changes.
**Status:** Working. Login returns `{ id, email, firstName, lastName, role, status }` + session with tokens.

#### `src/api/cart.js`

| 1   | **Product images not displaying anywhere**        | This is a multi-layer issue: (a) Seed products have `images: []` — no images were populated during SQL seeding, so all original demo products show placeholders. (b) Vendor-uploaded images: the upload UI is wired (`POST /suppliers/products/:id/images` with multipart `image` field) but after upload the `images` array in the database remains empty — the upload may be silently failing at the Supabase Storage level. (c) The `GET /suppliers/products` and `GET /admin/products` endpoints return raw storage paths instead of signed URLs, so even if images were stored, they wouldn't render on vendor/admin pages without the `resolveProductImages()` helper (which itself depends on the product being accessible via `GET /products/:id`). **Net result:** No product images display on any page — products page, product detail, cart, vendor portal, or admin panel all show placeholders. | Debug steps: (1) Open browser DevTools Console → try uploading an image → check for error messages. (2) Check Supabase Dashboard → Storage → verify `product-images` bucket exists. (3) Check backend terminal for storage errors during upload. (4) If bucket doesn't exist, run `npm run db:migrate` in backend to auto-create it. (5) If bucket exists but upload still fails, check Supabase service role key permissions. |
| 2   | **Image resolution limited for pending products** | The `resolveProductImages()` helper fetches via `GET /products/:id` which only returns active products. Pending/rejected products can't have images resolved this way — vendor portal will show placeholders for non-active products even if images exist.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Backend fix needed: add signed URL resolution to `GET /suppliers/products` endpoint, OR add a dedicated image URL endpoint                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### What's Wired Up But NOT Tested

**PayPal Payment** — Code complete, not tested. Need to go through checkout, select PayPal, and see if it redirects to PayPal sandbox. Depends on valid PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID and PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET in backend .env.

**Net30 Payment** — Code complete, not tested. Need to go through checkout, select Net30, and see if order places. Depends on whether backend returns eligible: true from GET /users/me/credit for the test user. If button is disabled, user is not eligible.

**Forgot Password Flow** — Page exists, not tested. Need to enter email, check if email sends, follow reset link, set new password.

**Reset Password Flow** — Page exists, not tested. Depends on forgot password working first.

**Email Verification** — Page exists, not tested. Depends on registration sending verification email.

**Customer Profile Edit** — Page exists, not tested. Need to go to /profile, try editing name/phone, save, and verify it persists.

**Vendor Order Fulfillment** — Code exists, not tested. Need to click "Mark shipped" on a vendor order, enter tracking number, and verify status updates.

**Admin Orders Page** — Page exists, not tested. May have field name mismatches like other pages had. Needs manual check.

**Admin Dashboard Stats** — Page exists, not tested. May have response parsing issues. Needs manual check.

**Admin Analytics** — Page exists, not tested. Revenue, trends, top products. May need field name fixes.

### What's NOT Working

**Product Images — Not Working Anywhere**

This is a multi-layer problem:

1. **Seed/demo products have no images.** They were inserted via SQL without any image data, so the images array is empty for all original products.

2. **Image upload may be silently failing.** The vendor portal has an image upload UI that calls the backend, but after uploading, the images array in the database remains empty. The Supabase Storage bucket (product-images) might not exist or might have permission issues.

3. **Vendor and admin pages can't display images even if they exist.** The backend's vendor endpoint (GET /suppliers/products) and admin endpoint (GET /admin/products) return raw storage paths like "supplier-123/product-456/image.jpg" instead of actual viewable URLs. Only the customer-facing endpoint (GET /products) converts these to signed URLs. A frontend workaround was added but it only works for approved/active products.

**To debug:** Open browser DevTools (F12) Console tab and try uploading an image from the vendor portal. Check if any error appears. Also check the Supabase Dashboard to verify the product-images storage bucket exists. If it doesn't exist, running npm run db:migrate in the backend should create it.

**To fully fix:** The backend needs to return signed URLs from the supplier and admin product endpoints, the same way it already does for the customer endpoint.

### Pages With No Changes Made (Untouched)

**Home Page** (/) — No changes. Working. Uses hardcoded Unsplash images.

**About Page** (/about) — No changes. Static content.

**Privacy Policy** (/privacy-policy) — No changes. Static content.

**Terms of Service** (/terms-of-service) — No changes. Static content.

**Vendor Agreement** (/vendor-agreement) — No changes. Static content.

**Commission Policy** (/commission-policy) — No changes. Static content.

**Footer Component** — No changes.

**Admin Compliance** (/admin/compliance) — No changes. Not tested.

**Supplier Register Page** — Orphan file. Not routed anywhere. Not used. Likely legacy code.

## Update — 2026-03-27 (QA Session 2)

### Backend Update

Backend was updated from `develop` branch. New commits pulled:

- `#50` — normalize product categories with official list
- `#51` — support comma-separated CORS origins
- `#52` — sync users table when admin approves/suspends supplier
- `#53` — switch email verification to 6-digit code
- `#46` — signed image URLs for supplier/admin + auto-approve customers

**Key backend fix:** Product images now return signed URLs from ALL endpoints (products, supplier products, admin products). Previously only the customer-facing GET /products resolved signed URLs.

### Frontend Changes Made (20 files, +1157 / -418 lines)

**src/api/client.js**

- Added token refresh logic. On 401 response, automatically attempts to refresh the access token using the stored refresh token. If refresh succeeds, retries the original request. If refresh fails, clears auth and redirects to /login.

**src/store/authStore.js**

- Added vendor-specific fields to registration payload (taxId, businessAddress, businessPhone, website, yearsInBusiness, businessLicense, fdaRegistration, categories, position) — sent when registering as supplier.
- Fixed logout to also clear refreshToken from localStorage.
- Role checks now use 'supplier' (matching backend) instead of 'vendor'.

**src/components/Navbar.jsx**

- Added "Admin Dashboard" link in desktop nav for admin users.
- Fixed user display name to use firstName/lastName from backend response.

**src/pages/ProductDetailPage.jsx — Major rewrite**

- Complete UI redesign to match provided reference screenshots.
- Added supplier comparison feature: fetches all products and matches by name (case-insensitive) to find same product from different vendors.
- Comparison box with radio-button supplier selection, "Best Price" and "Featured" badges, star ratings, stock counts.
- Single-supplier fallback card when only one vendor sells the product.
- "Selected supplier" summary card with gradient background.
- Redesigned quantity picker with cleaner styling.
- "Add to Cart" button shows selected supplier name.
- Key Features section extracted from product description as bullet points.
- Specifications section in gray rounded card.
- Trust badges row (FDA/Certified, Quality Assured, Fast Delivery, Secure Packaging) as bordered white cards.
- Removed toast notification on add to cart.
- Font consistency — font-display only on product title, everything else uses font-body (Inter).

**src/pages/ProductsPage.jsx — Major rewrite**

- Added filter reset button (RefreshCw icon) next to "Filters" heading. Appears only when any filter is active. Clears category, price range, stock filter, sort, and search.
- Added dynamic categories from useCategories hook instead of hardcoded constants.
- Added category color coding with CATEGORY_COLORS array.
- Added inferCategory utility for products without a category.
- Removed toast notification on add to cart.

**src/pages/OrderHistoryPage.jsx**

- Fixed response parsing: now checks data.orders (backend returns { orders: [...] }).
- Orders now automatically fetch full details on page load (GET /orders/:id for each order) to show item names, quantities, prices, and shipping address inline.
- Added "View Items" section showing product details, quantities, and line totals.
- Added shipping address display for each order.
- Invoice download uses full order details.

**src/pages/CartPage.jsx**

- Fixed "Proceed to Checkout" button — added flex layout so arrow icon sits inline with text instead of on a separate line.

**src/pages/PaymentPage.jsx**

- Net30 payment option commented out (intentional by user).
- Stripe and PayPal payment methods remain active.
- Payment flow: syncCartToBackend → createOrder → payment method specific logic.
- Note: Payment was blocked by Supabase RLS policy on orders table. User fixed by disabling RLS on orders, order_items, and order_status_history tables via Supabase Dashboard.

**src/pages/LoginPage.jsx**

- Minor adjustments to login flow.

**src/pages/RegisterPage.jsx**

- Now uses useCategories hook for dynamic product categories in vendor registration.
- After successful registration, redirects to /verify-email with email parameter.
- Success message includes "Check your email for a verification code."
- Added password strength validation matching backend requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special character).

**src/pages/HomePage.jsx**

- Reduced hardcoded category images.

**src/components/AdminLayout.jsx**

- Layout adjustments for admin panel.

**src/pages/admin/AdminDashboard.jsx**

- Dashboard stat adjustments.

**src/pages/admin/AdminVendors.jsx**

- Vendor management adjustments.

**src/pages/vendor/VendorProducts.jsx**

- Minor adjustments to vendor product management.

**src/pages/SupplierRegisterPage.jsx**

- Minor updates (orphan file, not routed).

**src/utils/constants.js**

- Updated category constants.

**vite.config.js**

- Dev server port configuration.

### Issues Found and Status

**Product images — NOW WORKING**
Backend fix #46 resolved signed image URLs for all endpoints. Product images now display correctly on the products page, product detail page, vendor portal, and admin panel for any product that has images uploaded.

**Payment (Stripe) — WORKING after RLS fix**
The "new row violates row-level security policy for table orders" error was a Supabase RLS issue. Fixed by running ALTER TABLE ... DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY on orders, order_items, and order_status_history tables in Supabase Dashboard. Stripe payment now completes successfully.

**Order history — WORKING**
Fixed response parsing and added automatic item detail fetching. Orders now show with product names, quantities, prices, and shipping address.

**Vendor registration fields — NOT FIXED (backend)**
The Zod validator in auth.validator.ts still only accepts 6 fields for supplier registration (email, password, firstName, lastName, phone, role). Extra fields (taxId, businessAddress, categories, website, etc.) are silently stripped. The frontend sends them correctly but the backend drops them. Backend dev needs to update the validator, controller, and service. The database columns already exist.

**PayPal payment — WORKING**
Initially showed "currently not available" because backend .env had no PayPal credentials. After adding PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID, PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET, and PAYPAL_MODE=sandbox to backend .env, PayPal payment works. Tested — clicking "Continue with PayPal" successfully creates the order and redirects to PayPal sandbox for approval. Full flow: order creation → PayPal order creation → redirect to PayPal → user approves → redirect back to app.

**Net30 payment — INTENTIONALLY DISABLED**
Commented out by user in PaymentPage.jsx.

## Update — 2026-03-31 (End-to-End Manual Testing)

### Frontend Fixes Applied

**Homepage categories not filtering** — ProductsPage now reads the `?category=` URL query parameter from the homepage category links and pre-selects that category in the sidebar filter. Previously clicking a category on the homepage showed all products.

**Add to cart auto-redirect removed** — Clicking "Add to Cart" on the product detail page no longer auto-redirects to the cart page. User stays on the product page and can continue browsing. Cart badge in the navbar still updates.

**Customer profile recent orders fixed** — The Recent Orders section on the customer profile page (/profile) was showing "No orders yet" even when orders existed. Fixed by: (1) correcting the response parsing to read `data.orders` instead of `data.data`, (2) fetching full order details (GET /orders/:id) for each order to get item names and quantities, (3) now shows the 2 most recent orders with product names, quantities, line totals, and shipping address.

### Issues Requiring Backend/DevOps Action (Not Frontend)

**Turnstile CAPTCHA not loading (Error 110200)** — The Cloudflare Turnstile site key is not authorized for the current domains. Fix: Go to Cloudflare Dashboard → Turnstile → edit the widget → add `localhost` and the Vercel app domain (e.g., `your-app.vercel.app`) to the allowed domains list.

**Vendor double approval required** — After admin approves a vendor in /admin/vendors, the vendor still cannot log in because the user account also needs separate approval in /admin/users. Backend dev needs to auto-approve the user record when the vendor/supplier is approved, so admins don't have to approve twice.

**Stripe/PayPal payments fail on production (Vercel + Render)** — Both payment methods return "Invalid Request Data" on the deployed Vercel app but work correctly on localhost. The production Render backend is either outdated (not deployed with latest fixes) or the production Supabase database still has Row Level Security enabled on the orders, order_items, and order_status_history tables. Backend dev needs to: (1) deploy the latest backend code to Render, and (2) verify RLS is disabled on those three tables in the production Supabase project.

**Categories endpoint 404** — The backend does not have a GET /api/categories endpoint. The frontend console shows 404 errors for this call but it is harmless — the frontend already falls back to a hardcoded list of 11 official categories. No action needed unless the backend team wants to add this endpoint.

_Frontend: APlus-frontend (branch: Samia)_
_Backend: APlusMedDepot-Backend (branch: develop, commit c0f35c6)_

---

## Update — 2026-04-01

**Navbar logo updated** — Replaced the full APMD logo with APMD_LOGO.png (icon without tagline) plus the "APlusMedDepot" text beside it — "APlus" in red, "MedDepot" in blue, matching the original branding from earlier commits.

**Favicon updated** — Changed browser tab icon to use APMD_FULL_LOGO.jpg (the full logo with tagline). Updated index.html to point to the new favicon file.

**Add to Cart button cleaned up** — Removed supplier name from the "Add to Cart" button on the product detail page. Now just says "Add to Cart" instead of "Add to Cart — Supplier Name".

**Code cleanup** — Removed unused imports (React, useNavigate, toast) from ProductDetailPage.jsx.

**Product detail page consistency** — Description section now always visible, shows "No description available." when empty. Key Features section now always visible, shows "No key features listed." when empty. Specification data is now merged into Key Features (e.g., "Accuracy: ±3 mmHg") instead of showing in a separate section. The standalone Specifications section has been removed. The fda_status field is filtered out from specs since it's already displayed as a badge.

**Single supplier card styling** — Updated the single-supplier price card to match the comparison section styling (same pink background, border, and rounded corners).

**Checkout button alignment** — Fixed "Continue to Payment" button on checkout page — icon was on a separate line, now inline with text.

**Homepage category images fixed** — Two categories ("Incontinence Care" and "Skin Biologics") had broken images. The categoryImages array only had 4 URLs for 8 categories, and one URL was broken. Expanded to 8 unique Unsplash URLs so each category has its own working image.

## Update — 2026-04-03

### Chatbot Integration

**Floating chatbot widget integrated** — New ChatWidget component (src/components/ChatWidget.jsx) connected to n8n webhook. Features: pill-shaped "Chat Now" button with APMD logo (bottom-right), expandable chat window with navy header, bot/user message bubbles, typing indicator, session persistence via localStorage UUID, "New Chat" button, Escape to close, mobile responsive (full-width on small screens). Bot responses render newlines properly and URLs are clickable links that open in new tabs.

**Chatbot response parsing fixed** — The webhook returns plain text (not JSON), so response parsing was updated to handle both formats.

### Product Detail Page

**Supplier comparison fuzzy matching** — Comparison section now uses fuzzy name matching instead of exact. Strips parentheses content and trailing numbers before comparing (e.g., "Surgical Face Mask", "Surgical Face Mask (black)", "Surgical Face Mask (50 pcs)" all group together).

**Comparison navigation** — Clicking a different supplier's row in the comparison section navigates directly to that product's detail page instead of just selecting a radio button. The current product's supplier is always the default selection.

**Multi-image gallery** — Products with multiple images now show a thumbnail row below the main image. Clicking a thumbnail switches the main image. Selected thumbnail has a red border highlight.

**Image sizing** — Product grid uses aspect-[4/3] with object-cover. Product detail uses aspect-square with object-cover. Consistent across all products.

**Specifications merged into Key Features** — Removed the standalone Specifications section. Spec data (excluding fda_status) is now shown as bullet points under Key Features.

**Description always visible** — Shows "No description available." when empty instead of hiding the section.

**Key Features always visible** — Shows "No key features listed." when empty instead of hiding the section.

**Single supplier card restyled** — Now matches the comparison section styling (same pink background, red border, rounded corners).

### Products Page

**Server-side sorting** — Sort dropdown now re-fetches from backend with proper sort params (sortBy + sortOrder) instead of sorting client-side on loaded products only. Options: Newest First, Price Low to High, Price High to Low, Name A-Z.

**Category counts from backend** — Each category in the sidebar shows accurate product counts fetched via pagination.total from the backend (one lightweight request per category, run in parallel on page load).

**Homepage category filtering** — ProductsPage reads ?category= URL param from homepage category links and pre-selects that filter.

**Filter reset icon** — Refresh icon next to "Filters" heading clears all filters when clicked.

**All products loaded** — Removed 20-product pagination limit. All products fetched at once (backend max 100 per request). Load More button removed. Note: when product count exceeds 100, pagination or a backend limit increase will be needed.

### Admin Panel

**Admin products pagination** — Reverted from limit:100 to default pagination. Admin can now see all products by scrolling through pages.

### Other Fixes

**Vendor registration fields** — Removed businessLicense from registration payload (database column doesn't exist). Kept companyName, taxId, businessAddress, yearsInBusiness, categories.

**Add to Cart no longer redirects** — Stays on product detail page after adding to cart.

**Cart button alignment** — "Proceed to Checkout" button icon now inline with text.

**Checkout button alignment** — "Continue to Payment" button icon now inline with text.

**Navbar logo updated** — APMD_LOGO.png icon + "APlusMedDepot" text (APlus in red, MedDepot in blue). Logo size increased to h-14 for better proportion.

**Favicon updated** — Browser tab now uses APMD_FULL_LOGO.jpg.

**Homepage category images** — Fixed 2 broken Unsplash URLs. Expanded from 4 to 8 unique images.

**Customer profile recent orders** — Fixed response parsing and now fetches full order details. Shows 2 most recent orders with product names, quantities, and prices.

### Known Issues (Not Frontend)

**Chatbot "Book a Call"** — Returns CALENDAR_LINK_PLACEHOLDER instead of actual URL. Needs to be fixed in the n8n workflow.

**Turnstile CAPTCHA** — Still showing Error 110200. Domains need to be added in Cloudflare Dashboard.

**Backend product limit** — Max 100 products per API request. Will need increasing as catalog grows.

**Admin product deactivation** — No endpoint to set a product to "inactive" from admin side. Backend feature request.

## Update — 2026-04-05

**Homepage category images switched to ImgBB** — Local images in public/home_category_img/ were not loading despite files being valid. Switched all 8 category images to externally hosted ImgBB URLs for reliable loading. Each category now has its own dedicated image mapped by name (Wound Care, Vascular Access, Incontinence Care, Gloves, Nursing Care Supplies, Enteral Feeding Tubes, Skin Biologics, Advanced Wound Care).

**Homepage banner reverted** — Trial banner image was tested but reverted back to the original Unsplash image for now.

## Update — 2026-04-19

### Admin Panel Fixes

**Admin Orders page fixed** — Four bugs resolved: (1) Date column showed "Invalid Date" — fixed by reading `createdAt` (camelCase) instead of `created_at`. (2) Customer name was blank — fixed by reading `customerName` and `customerEmail` from backend response. (3) Total showed $0.00 — fixed by reading `totalAmount` (camelCase). (4) Eye icon now works — opens a modal showing full order details including status summary, customer info, shipping address, order items table, and status history. Added `getAdminOrderById` API function. Status filter dropdown updated with actual backend status values.

**Admin Products page** — Increased fetch limit to 100 so all products appear in the list and stats cards show correct counts.

**Admin Orders page** — Increased fetch limit to 100 to show all orders.

**Admin Analytics page rewritten** — Fixed all NaN values in KPI cards by reading correct camelCase field names from backend response (`current.totalSales`, `current.totalCommission`, `current.orderCount`). Products count now uses `pagination.total` from a lightweight API call instead of counting loaded products. Revenue trend chart fixed to read `date`/`revenue`/`orders` from backend. "Monthly Site Visitors" replaced with "Orders Trend" (backend doesn't track visitors). Top Products section now reads `productName`/`totalRevenue`/`totalSold`/`supplierName`. Category breakdown now fetches from dedicated `GET /admin/analytics/revenue/categories` endpoint showing actual sales data per category, merged with the full category list so all 11 categories are visible even with zero activity. Period selector maps UI values (7d/30d/90d/all) to backend values (week/month/quarter/all). Vendor performance table reads correct camelCase fields (`supplierName`/`totalSales`/`platformCommission`).

**Admin Users page fixed** — User name and date fields updated to read camelCase (`firstName`/`lastName`/`createdAt`). "Company" column replaced with "Role" column showing colored badges. Eye icon now works — opens a modal showing user details, contact info, supplier details (business name, tax ID, commission rate, balance) for vendors, and customer stats (total orders, total spent) for customers. Added `getAdminUserById` API function. Increased fetch limit to 100.

### Vendor Portal Fixes

**Vendor Analytics page rewritten** — Now fetches from `getSupplierDashboard()` for accurate KPIs (revenueThisMonth, ordersThisMonth, activeProducts, averageOrderValue). Revenue trend reads correct backend fields (`date`/`revenue`/`orderCount`). Category breakdown shows all 11 categories merged with vendor's product data. Commission summary shows accurate values from backend.

**Vendor Orders filters fixed** — Filter buttons updated to match actual backend order status values (`pending_payment`, `payment_confirmed`, `awaiting_fulfillment`, `partially_shipped`, `fully_shipped`, `delivered`). Status badge colors properly mapped. Status text replaces all underscores. Note: Order status update (fulfillment) feature was attempted but reverted due to complexity with the backend's sub-order/order-item relationship — needs further investigation.

### Branding

**"APlusMed" replaced with "APMD"** — Updated in 4 places: HomePage ("Why Choose APMD?", "...trust APMD for their..."), Navbar ("Sell on APMD"), SupplierRegisterPage ("Join APMD's marketplace"). Logos and links left unchanged.

**Homepage banner** — Switched to full-background banner using `BannerAPMD.png` with left-side dark gradient overlay. Text overlay on left side. Added Swiper slider with 3 slides (BannerAPMD.png, slider02.jpg, slide03.jpg) using fade effect, 5-second delay, 1.5-second transition speed, pagination dots.

**Footer phone number** — Updated to +844-722-2763.

**SAMPLE badge** — Commented out the "SAMPLE - Not For Purchase" badge on product cards.

### Products Page

**All products loaded** — Removed 20-product limit. All products fetched at once (backend max 100). Load More button removed. Server-side sorting retained.

**Category counts from backend** — Each category shows accurate count via `pagination.total` from lightweight per-category API calls.

### Known Issues (Remaining)

**Vendor order fulfillment** — Status update button does not work. The backend's list endpoint returns sub-orders without order_item IDs. The fulfillment update endpoint requires order_item IDs. Fetching details for each order to get item IDs causes rate limiting. Needs a backend solution (either return item IDs in the list endpoint or provide a batch fulfillment update endpoint).

**Backend product limit** — Max 100 products per API request. Will need increasing as catalog grows beyond 100 products.
